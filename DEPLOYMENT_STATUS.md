## üîÑ Next Steps (Manual Actions Required)

### Step 1: Add PostgreSQL Database (2 minutes)
**Action Required via Railway Dashboard:**

1. Go to: https://railway.com/project/bf11a721-7920-4940-bd78-e51ce48b9270
2. Click the **"New"** button in the top right
3. Select **"Database"**
4. Choose **"Add PostgreSQL"**
5. Railway will automatically:
   - Provision a PostgreSQL database
   - Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
   - Make it available to all services in this project

‚úÖ **Expected Result:** You'll see a new "Postgres" service in your project

---

### Step 2: Create Application Service (3 minutes)
**Choose ONE of the following options:**

#### **Option A: Deploy from Local (Recommended for testing)**
1. In Railway dashboard, click **"New"**
2. Select **"Empty Service"**
3. Name it: `smerptek-website-app`
4. Then run from your terminal:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Development\smerptek-website\smerp-tek
   railway service
   # Select the service you just created
   railway up
   ```

#### **Option B: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended for production)**
1. Push your code to GitHub (if not already done)
2. In Railway dashboard, click **"New"**
3. Select **"GitHub Repo"**
4. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub
5. Select your `smerptek-website` repository
6. Railway will automatically:
   - Detect it's a Next.js application
   - Use the `railway.json` and `nixpacks.toml` configurations
   - Build and deploy automatically

‚úÖ **Expected Result:** Your application will start building and deploying

---

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables (5 minutes)
**Action Required via Railway Dashboard:**

1. Click on your **application service** (not the database)
2. Go to the **"Variables"** tab
3. Add the following variables:

```bash
# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app-domain.up.railway.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<click-generate-or-use-openssl-rand-base64-32>

# Admin Credentials
ADMIN_EMAIL=salehelhalik@gmail.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=Smerptek03554939!

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

**Note:** Replace `your-app-domain` with the actual domain Railway assigns to your service (visible in service settings ‚Üí "Domains")

‚úÖ **Expected Result:** Variables will be available to your application

---

### Step 4: Deploy & Run Migrations (5 minutes)

#### If you used Option A (Local Deploy):
```bash
# From your project directory
cd C:\Development\smerptek-website\smerp-tek

# Deploy
railway up

# After deployment succeeds, run migrations
railway run npx prisma migrate deploy
```

#### If you used Option B (GitHub Deploy):
1. Railway will automatically deploy when you push to GitHub
2. After deployment succeeds, run migrations:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Development\smerptek-website\smerp-tek
   railway link  # Link to your project if not already linked
   railway run npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

‚úÖ **Expected Result:** Database tables created successfully

---

### Step 5: Verify Deployment (2 minutes)

1. **Check Deployment Status:**
   ```bash
   railway status
   ```

2. **View Logs:**
   ```bash
   railway logs --follow
   ```

3. **Access Your Application:**
   - Go to your Railway service settings
   - Find the "Domains" section
   - Click on the generated domain (e.g., `smerptek-website.up.railway.app`)
   - Your application should be live!

4. **Test Database Connection:**
   - Navigate to `/api/health` (if you have a health endpoint)
   - Or test by creating a form submission on your contact page

‚úÖ **Expected Result:** Application loads successfully with database connectivity

## üöÄ Quick Start Command Sequence

If you want to deploy everything quickly after completing Steps 1-3 above:

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd C:\Development\smerptek-website\smerp-tek

# Link to your service (if using local deploy)
railway service

# Deploy application
railway up

# Run migrations
railway run npx prisma migrate deploy

# Check status
railway status

# View logs
railway logs --follow
```

## üìã Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist to track your progress:

- [ ] **Step 1:** PostgreSQL database added via Railway dashboard
- [ ] **Step 2:** Application service created (Empty Service or GitHub Repo)
- [ ] **Step 3:** Environment variables configured in service settings
- [ ] **Step 4:** Application deployed successfully
- [ ] **Step 5:** Database migrations completed
- [ ] **Step 6:** Application accessible via public URL
- [ ] **Step 7:** Database connection verified (can create/read data)

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
**Problem:** Railway build process fails

**Solution:**
- Check logs: `railway logs`
- Ensure `nixpacks.toml` is present (‚úÖ already created)
- Verify `package.json` has correct scripts
- Check for missing dependencies

### Database Connection Issues
**Problem:** App can't connect to database

**Solution:**
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set in environment variables
- Check PostgreSQL service is running (should show green in dashboard)
- Confirm migrations were run: `railway run npx prisma migrate deploy`

### Environment Variables Not Working
**Problem:** Variables not available in application

**Solution:**
- Ensure variables are set in the **application service**, not the database service
- Redeploy after changing variables: `railway up` or push to GitHub
- Check variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Migration Fails
**Problem:** `prisma migrate deploy` fails

**Solution:**
- Ensure DATABASE_URL is set and correct
- Check Prisma schema is valid
- Try resetting migrations (only if safe): `railway run npx prisma migrate reset --skip-seed`
