## üéØ Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Sequential (Recommended)
Build in order: Phase 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4

**Pros:**
- Clear progress
- Can deploy public site early
- Add admin later

**Cons:**
- No content management initially

### Option 2: Parallel
Build Phase 1 + Phase 2 simultaneously

**Pros:**
- Can manage content immediately
- Faster to "fully functional"

**Cons:**
- More complex
- Testing harder

### Option 3: MVP First
Build: Phase 1 + Basic Phase 2 (login + simple forms) + Deploy

**Pros:**
- Fastest to production
- Can iterate based on feedback

**Cons:**
- Limited functionality initially

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tips

### 1. Copy Content Directly

**The brand package has all copy** - don't rewrite it! Just format it properly:

```typescript
// Example: Copy from brand package
const heroTitle = "Operations that clarify, not complicate";
const heroSubtitle = "SMERP TEK modernizes digital operations...";
```

### 2. Reuse Components

You already have:
- Button
- Card
- Input
- Label

Build on top of these - don't recreate!

### 3. Use AI Tools

For repetitive work:
- GitHub Copilot for autocomplete
- ChatGPT for component templates
- v0.dev for quick UI mockups

### 4. Test as You Go

Don't build everything then test. After each page:
1. Check mobile responsive
2. Test keyboard navigation
3. Verify links work
4. Check console for errors

### 5. Commit Frequently

```bash
# After each page or feature
git add .
git commit -m "feat(products): add SMERP EDU product page"
git push
```
